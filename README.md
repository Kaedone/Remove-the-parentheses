Your task is to remove everything inside the parentheses as well as the parentheses themselves.
The example above would return:

```Python
    "exampleexample"
```

Other than parentheses only letters and spaces can occur in the string. Don't worry about other brackets like `"[]"` and `"{}"` as these will never appear.
